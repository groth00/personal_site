I'm Gabriel (I go by Gabe), and I'm actively looking for a full-time position as a software engineer. Feel free to contact me at groth00.work@gmail.com if you're recruiting or if you just want to say hi!

I have a Bachelor's degree in Statistics from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and a Master's degree in Data Analytics from San Jose State University.

I have about 2 years of professional experience as a Data Scientist from January 2023 to October 2024. The role involved deploying ML projects to AWS with CircleCI, Docker, and Terraform using Python.

I'm mainly interested in software engineering (backend) and have been reading books and working on side projects. Currently, my programming language of choice is Rust, though I've made REST APIs and served HTML with Go and Python and am comfortable working with those languages as well.
